v0: 
    conquer unmanned planets √

v1: 
    attack to closest enemy planet when all planets occupied √

v2: 
    if in docking range but can't dock, aim at nearby enemy ships √
    improve collision detect from huizew √
    Search and Attack in all cases √

v3: 37.22, rank 179
    first priority attack docking/docked ships within 84 units √
    timeout control √

v4: 36.95 rank:310
    - Improve judge starting with rush with distance threshold
    - before docking, if enemy exists nearby, don't dock -> attack enemy ship (not best choice but still better than docking )
    - count rush (undock all and charge)
    - simple close combat, attack nearby enemies

v5: 38.81, rank :245
    - better planet finding 
    - rewrite the prioirt control for ship command

v6:
    - comment rush mode since there appears to have some bugs

(fix version records)

v12: 
    - try to fix the rush decision 

v13:
    - fix bug

v15: 34.01, rank 529
    - when attacking incoming enemy, consider their past speed to intercept instead of chasing
    - sort all ships based on distance to closest enemy before issuing commands, by modifying get all free ships function

v16: 37.92, rank 278
    - fix minor bug

v17: 38.67 rank 245
    - keep task consisteny by remembering conquer and defense task and resume them when no close by threat    
    - first iterate through task than ships, make sure no time out and easier to control task priority
    - store the task on each ship, don't let it seems to be hesitant (only allow turn to more prioritized task)
    
v18: 33.48, rank 561
    - change constants if 4 players

v19: 41.87, rank 167
    - fix no rush bug

v20: 44.75, rank 106
    - add battle status assessment to "combat", smart retreat and rescue

v21: 47.92, rank 62
    - improve close combat

v22: 50.6, rank 50
    - add auto grouping 

v23: 
    - grid search a lot of parameters, thounds of test on rush parameter
    - fix bug in any ratio and no ratio, which stops the ship under these two commands
    - when retreat, add a factor to replace the current mid point of escape point and ally point
    - fix bug in time control
    - haven't finished grid search and tuning

v24:
    - continue grid search, tuning grouping and retreat balance
    - 2nd level time control
    - grid search 2p planet factor
    - grid search when to rush 

v25:
    - improve 4p parameters
    - grid search 4p planet factor
    - differnt hunting range for 2p and 4p (play more conservative for 4p)

v26:
    - total rewrite navigation system, use field retreat to replace original retreat; didn't replace the original 
    - haven't fixed the boundary angle direction when retreating

v27:
    - roll back to v25, but remove suicide

v28:
    - retreat to cloeset point (WEAPON+ MOVE +1) + 0.5 allypoint grouping

v29:
    - compute field_score for all ships in begining
    - improve close combat choice
    - rush optimize path, multiple calc the navi

v30:
    - remove rescue
    - optimize 4p parameters, basically same as 2p

v31:
    - no rescue
    - steal

v32:
    - turn off steal

v33:
    - improve time control

todo:
    - tempo, soften nto1 ratio sometimes
    - * improve attack weak enemy by adding avoid incoming ships function!
        - improve 4p with special tactics,  rush the cloest one when in advantage/close distance, allow switch back from rush to 
    - use movement field to avoid enemy, improve the current keep_from as well
    - what should the ship do when stealing task is finished?

    - similar idea: allow split one ship to rush in the first place (let ALLOW_DOCK be a property of ship?)
    # todo: we can try curve+field to close combat

future features:
    - dock more when 4p
